To do:

- refactor for DRY principle (any methods that should be combined?)
- abstract classes out of game_loop that should stand on their own

- get player name when game starts
- refactor each condition of if/else into a separate method, then rewrite as a case statement that
  calls the method e.g. 'case x then method_call'
- import instructions from file (store instructions as their own class)
- save player scores to file
- call instructions for incorrect input
- move from 1 to 2 items in guess array
- remove 'puts sequence'

- GUESS CHECK ALGORITHM
